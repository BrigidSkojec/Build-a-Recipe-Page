  <h1>Emotionally Boiled Noodles</h1>
  <p>These noodles didn’t choose the boil. The boil chose them.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2 box of pasta (any shape—no one’s judging, except Italians)
</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced like your dignity after texting first</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>Crushed red pepper flakes (just enough to feel alive which may be a shit ton)</li>
    <li>Grated parmesan (yes, you can use the kind in the green can)</li>
    <li>Salt (for the pasta water and your soul)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Intructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Boil water in a pot. Add salt like you’re seasoning generational trauma.</li>
    <li>Throw in your pasta. Cook until al dente or until you forget and it’s mush—whatever.</li>
    <li>While pasta’s having its hot bath, heat olive oil in a pan. Add garlic. Let it sizzle until golden or slightly burnt because you definitely got distracted.</li>
    <li>Add red pepper flakes. Don’t go wild unless you’re into culinary self-harm.</li>
    <li>Drain the pasta (save a lil’ water like a responsible adult), then toss it into the pan like it's your ex’s hoodie you definitely meant to return.</li>
    <li>Stir. Add parmesan. If it looks dry, splash in some pasta water. Boom—sauce.</li>
    <li>Eat straight from the pan like the feral queen you are.</li>
  </ol>
